            <br>
            <p>For our student's contacts, it is 107s.(first letter of first name)(last name)@nhascholar.com. For an example, if we have Jessica Anderson, it would be; 107s.janderson. If there is another person with an indentical account name coming after someone else, we would add a 2 to the end of it. Jordan Anderson is an example of this, it would be, 107s.janderson2nhascholar.com.</p>
            <br>
            <p>For our teachers, deans and principal, it is the same scenario, just one difference. We need to be able to tell who is a student and who isn't, we remove the "s" after the "107". This is because the "s" means scholar.</p>

            <p>Thanks for reading and we hope this helps you indentify emails for our school.</p>

                <div class= "line"></div>
            <p>Here at Peak, we believe extra curricular will help your child exeed in talents other than academics. We have 4 main specials, art, music, PE (physical education/exercise), technology, starting at Kindergarten to 5th grade, one special each quarter of the school year. After this, we use electives which allows students to choose certain activities within, art, music, PE, music. One requirement is you have to choose at least one activity for PE.</p>
            <br>
            <p>If you have any questions, feel free to email us or ask us in person. Thanks for reading. :)</p>

            <p>Classes are different within different classrooms and grades. If we include Social Studies, we have 4 classes; ELA (English Language Arts), Math, Science, and Social Studies. Three classes if we don't include social studies. Teachers will go more in detail in classrooms about schedules, amount of classes, how long they will be, ect.</p>

            <div class = "line"></div>
            <p>In the morning we would normally start with carpool and get everyone into the school. After that we would unpack and grap all of our materials, which vary between grade levels and subjects. After that we do moral focus which consists of a moral focus virtue the students learn about, the moral changes after a new month. Then you do your normal classes, which vary from grade levels. Lunch, recess, and spcecials timings vary from grade levels. Then dismissal, which is when the students leave school. Hope this helps :)</p>
